For this project, I think I want to use my bugs from the abstract clock and create a sort of game. I'm thinking about having the mouse be a sort of foor (i.e. pizza ) and have the bugs roaming around. The mouse needs to avoid the bugs and if the bugs do touch the mouse something happens (game over?). I'm also thinking that everytime you click a certain key, the bugs change type and go faster– different levels.

* this did not end up happening, but I wanted to keep it in mind for the future.

What I ended up doing was creating different cake componants– cake, frosting, candles and flames– which can be added or taken away based on what keys you press. You can also place new cakes when you press the mouse and that cake will retain it's origional componants.
