# p5.js multi sketch template

Please use this tempate to create a repository that contains your coursework for Creative Coding this semester. When you are creating a new item in your repository (either notes from a lecture, or a new assignment) please follow these two steps:

1. make a copy of the "template" folder and rename it to match your given activity (week1 or assignment1, for instance). 
2. add a line to the list in the "index.html" file in the root folder of your repository, which will create a link to your new activity:

```
      <li><a href="./week1/">Week 1 notes</a></li>
      <li><a href="./assignment1/">Assignment 1: Generative Drawing</a></li>
      ...
```
You can simply copy the line above, replacing the directory name with the name of the folder you've just created, and the inner text with a description of the new activity.
