> “As a result, instead of optimizing our machines for humanity—or even the benefit of some particular group—we are optimizing humans for machinery.” Douglas Rushkoff pg. 15

*This quote stood out to me because it brakes down our past relationship with machinery and how even through this new technology, we still are conforming ourselves into the mold of the machine. He compares the usurption of labor by machines to the devaluing of human thought in this digital age. It strengthens a hierarchical system that leaves the majority of people in the hands of the few.* 

> “Once these skills and machines started becoming essential to industry and government, they were reclassified as jobs for male experts. Women  were  then  deskilled  and  downgraded,  emerging  “as  the operators of machinery, [who] do not have, nor are expected to have, knowledge of the inner workings of those machines.” Jathan Sadowski pg. 39

*I picked this quote because of how it tied to some of the issues referenced in the Rushkoff text. It speaks to the power structure within machinery and the development of productivity and value. “Technology” is only seen as futuristic and when it becomes common, the knowledge needed to use the machine can become compartmentalized and the labor of the actual humans working on it becomes less valuable. Through this, we can see how different people are valued within society based on the believed amount of capital they can contribute.*
