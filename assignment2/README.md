Description

My idea for this project was to create a clock that adds bugs to it as time passes. There are three different bugsâ€“ one for second, one for minute and one for hour. And I also have a timer in the corner so you can see the time pass as you watch the bugs multiply.

I initially wanted the ants (at the time I was only using one bug) to drop bits of dirt to slowly fill the window up over time but then realize my skills are not there yet. I watched a lot of similar projects on p5.js (linked below) and got some good inspiration for how I wanted the ants to look from that, however most of the projects I looked at had similar elements to what I wanted to do, but I found that using patchwork techniques for my code did not work. The professor then gave be some exaples of code to incorperate uses what we've learned in class and so I changed that and the only difference visually is that the ants don't move, they shake because I used the drunk walk for them.
