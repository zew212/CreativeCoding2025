This is a reflection after I finished but I had a lot of trouble with figuring out how to change elements within the loop (a lot of deleting went on). 

I started with the idea of having a grid with circles like what we did in class but when the mouse moved the circles would move if the mouse hit them, however I already knew that was a bit more than I knew at that point. Instead, I decided to use the randomness code (found on p5.js) and made it so when the X value of the mouse was low, the grid was more intact and when it was high, they are going everywhere. I also included a circle (yellow) that's center point is the mouse and the diameter gets larger as the Y value increases.

Something I couldn't figure out is how to only make the loop run when the mouse is pressed.
