Description

My idea for this project was to create a clock that adds ants to it each minute. I also have a "speed up timer" that speeds up both the visual clock and well as the number of added ants so you can see how it runs without having to wait around for an hour. My program resets every hour, but I haven't gotten the speed up timer to reset like that yet so I need to do that for next class. I also am going to have the ants (or many the background) change color everyday so that's something I will also work on for next class. I kind of want to change what type of insect is shown every day instead of changing the color, but this took me so long already, I don't know if I will be able to do that (but we'll see!).

I initially wanted the ants to drop bits of dirt to slowly fill the window up over time but then realize my skills are not there yet. I watched a lot of similar projects on p5.js (linked below) and got some good inspiration for how I wanted the ants to look from that, however most of the projects I looked at had similar elements to what I wanted to do, but I found that using patchwork techniques for my code did not work. I had one of my friends help me with starting the program (just making the ants move around) but I'm going to be honest I think he used ChatGBT to create it and since he was in a hurry he didn't have time to explain how it worked to me so I still didn't really have any idea of what I was doing. After watching a lot of tutorials, I ended up getting the co pilot feature on VS code which actually helped a lot and explained how things worked (and didn't work). I used this for a lot of my code, I will be honest, but doing it step by step and having it explain everything to me taught me a lot.

** I also need to make it so during the first minute, there is always one ant
