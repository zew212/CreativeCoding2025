Going on the lines of the halloween theme, this is a cauldron thats being stirred. I got the inspiration from think code https://editor.p5js.org/tamaki.komatsuzaki/sketches/7gYExWkrC. The circle is supposed to be a bubble to show the motion of the potion and the line is the spood that is stirring it.
